# Advent Calendar 2018

This is my first advent calendar, as a gift for my dear one.

## How this works

There is a block for each day from now until Christmas (December 25th). It is a countdown for the holidays. 

In every block there is a surprise, something that reminds me of you, a song, a letter, all made with love and care. Open up one block every day to see it. Try not to look ahead to keep the surprise ;-)

## Why? 

This is to show you how grateful I am for being together with you and to bring you joy in this time to celebrate life and all that is good. Consider it as a Christmas gift.  I hope you enjoy it.
