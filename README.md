# Advent Calendar 2018

This is my first advent calendar, as a gift for my dear one.

## How this works

There is a block for each day from now until Christmas (December 25th).

Iin every block there is a gift, a message or something else done and put together here with love and care. Open up one block every day to see the surprise I selected.

## Why? 

This is to show you how grateful I am for being together with you and to bring you joy in this time to celebrate life and all good. Consider it as a Christmas gift.  I hope you enjoy it.
